	abstract = {The domain name system (DNS) has been an important base of the Internet; however, it faces various issues, including DNS server attacks. Blockchain-based DNS services have recently emerged to solve these DNS issues. Among them, Handshake provides a decentralized root zone and supports state-of-the-art features. However, few studies have investigated the performance evaluations of Handshake. We measure the name resolution latency on Handshake to assess its suitability as an alternative to the current DNS root servers and reveal that it has a practical drawback compared to current root servers at the current early stage.},

  abstract={Some web browsers working on certain operating systems (OSs) specify that a single-word search query entered into the search bar be sent to the recursive resolver of the domain name system (DNS) as a DNS request that includes the word. Such behavior is unexpected for users and induces privacy concerns through single-word search query leakage. We present our survey on the conditions during which this behavior occurs. By analyzing the DNS traffic captured at the recursive resolvers, we demonstrate that a considerable number of queries are leaked and the interests of individuals or organizations can be inferred through passive eavesdroppers.},

	abstract={The current domain name system (DNS) relies on specific organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers for its administration. Therefore, misconfigurations or arbitrary deployments by these organizations may have a negative impact on the Internet. Handshake, which is a blockchain-based DNS service, can offer an alternative and extended system to the current DNS by managing the root zone on the blockchain without relying on specific organizations. This paper addresses the following research question: Can Handshake replace the current DNS in the future? At the time of this writing, this is the first detailed analysis of Handshake, with a particular focus on undesirable activities and security issues observable from the blockchain data. By discussing concerns regarding malicious usage of domain names, such as domain squatting, with the usage cost data, the paper demonstrates that there is a significant possibility of domain name abuse with lower cost in general. Furthermore, by discussing system redundancy as part of the blockchain-based DNS, it shows that there is a likelihood for lower redundancy of authoritative DNS servers. In response to the research question, the paper concludes that Handshake cannot and should not replace the current DNS in the future without resolving these issues through the introduction of security measures for general users.},

	abstract={An authentication technique based on the domain name system (DNS), called DNS-based authentication of named entities (DANE), has been used to support the simple mail transfer protocol. However, DANE has not been extensively used for hypertext transfer protocol secure. This is possibly attributed to the increase in latency caused by DNS security extensions, which are essential for DANE. Unlike email services, web-service access is negatively impacted by latency which considerably affects the quality of experience for end users. This study assessed the extent to which DANE affects webpage load time. To investigate the load time, we developed DANEWebPerf, a tool—comprising a web browser, DNS cache server, and proxy that enables DANE use—to measure the webpage load time. Our experiments showed that using DANE increased the average webpage load time by at most 1190.9 ms. Therefore, DANE for the web does not significantly impact the quality of experience of end users.},
