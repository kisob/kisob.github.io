	abstract = {The domain name system (DNS) has been an important base of the Internet; however, it faces various issues, including DNS server attacks. Blockchain-based DNS services have recently emerged to solve these DNS issues. Among them, Handshake provides a decentralized root zone and supports state-of-the-art features. However, few studies have investigated the performance evaluations of Handshake. We measure the name resolution latency on Handshake to assess its suitability as an alternative to the current DNS root servers and reveal that it has a practical drawback compared to current root servers at the current early stage.},

  title = {Privacy Concerns From Single-Word Search Query Leakage From Web Browsers Through {DNS}},
  journal = {{IEEE} Networking Letters},
  abbr={LNET},
  abstract={Some web browsers working on certain operating systems (OSs) specify that a single-word search query entered into the search bar be sent to the recursive resolver of the domain name system (DNS) as a DNS request that includes the word. Such behavior is unexpected for users and induces privacy concerns through single-word search query leakage. We present our survey on the conditions during which this behavior occurs. By analyzing the DNS traffic captured at the recursive resolvers, we demonstrate that a considerable number of queries are leaked and the interests of individuals or organizations can be inferred through passive eavesdroppers.},
